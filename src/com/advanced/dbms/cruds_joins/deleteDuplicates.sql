Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id. Note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

After running your script, the answer shown is the person table. The driver will first compile,delete and run your piece of code and then show id of the Person table.

Table: person(
id int,
email varchar)
