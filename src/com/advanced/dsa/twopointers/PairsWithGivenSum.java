/**
 * Pairs with given sum II
 *
 * Problem Description
 * Given a sorted array of integers (not necessarily distinct) A and an integer B, find and return how many pair of integers ( A[i], A[j] ) such that i != j have sum equal to B.
 *
 * Since the number of such pairs can be very large, return number of such pairs modulo (109 + 7).
 *
 *
 *
 * Problem Constraints
 * 1 <= |A| <= 100000
 *
 * 1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
 *
 * 1 <= B <= 10^9
 *
 *
 *
 * Input Format
 * The first argument given is the integer array A.
 *
 * The second argument given is integer B.
 *
 *
 *
 * Output Format
 * Return the number of pairs for which sum is equal to B modulo (10^9+7).
 *
 *
 *
 * Example Input
 * Input 1:
 *
 * A = [1, 1, 1]
 * B = 2
 * Input 2:
 *
 *
 * A = [1, 1]
 * B = 2
 *
 *
 * Example Output
 * Output 1:
 *
 *  3
 * Output 2:
 *
 *  1
 *
 *
 * Example Explanation
 * Explanation 1:
 *
 *  Any two pairs sum up to 2.
 * Explanation 2:
 *
 *  only pair (1, 2) sums up to 2.

        Let us formulate a two pointer approach to the this problem.
        We will first sort the given array and use two pointers i and j with i = 0, j = Length of Array - 1.
        We will have three conditions:

        1. A[i] + A[j] < sum  --> We will increase the pointer i.
        2. A[i] + A[j] > sum  --> We will decrease the pointer j.
        3. A[i] + A[j] = sum  --> We will count the frequency of A[i] and A[j] and multiply them and add to the answer.

        Note, that if A[i] and A[j] are equal in value, then we will have to change the formula instead:
        freq(A[i]) * freq(A[i])  --> freq(A[i]) * (freq(A[i]) - 1) / 2
        to avoid overcounting pairs.

        Refer to the complete solution for more details.
